# Tornado Solana Development Progress & Context

## Last Updated: 2024-01-26 (Session 2)
**Current Status: 🟡 ALMOST READY - Real proof verification failing, needs verifying key fix**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We have successfully:
- ✅ Generated real proofs from the withdraw_fixed.circom circuit
- ✅ Completed trusted setup with withdraw_final.zkey
- ✅ All 14 basic tests passing (mock data)
- ❌ **BLOCKER**: Real proof verification fails - verifying key integration incomplete

**Critical Next Step**: Fix `verifying_key.rs` to load actual VK bytes from `circuits/build/vk_bytes.json`

---

## 📁 Current File Structure & Status

### Working Files ✅
- `lib.rs` - Core logic fixed, all borrow checker errors resolved
- `integration_tests.rs` - 7/7 tests passing
- `simple_test.rs` - 3/3 tests passing  
- `merkle_tree.rs` - Poseidon hash working, matches JS
- `circuits/withdraw_fixed.circom` - Compiled successfully

### Files Needing Fix ❌
- **`verifying_key.rs`** - Currently returns placeholder zeros, needs to load actual VK
- **`real_proof_test.rs`** - Test written but fails due to VK issue

### Generated Artifacts ✅
- `circuits/build/withdraw_final.zkey` - 5.4MB proving key
- `circuits/build/verification_key.json` - Human-readable VK
- `circuits/build/vk_bytes.json` - 3584 bytes for Rust integration
- `circuits/test_proof_valid.json` - Real proof with 8 public inputs

---

## 🔍 Current Blocker: Verifying Key Integration

### The Problem
```rust
// In verifying_key.rs - THIS IS WRONG
static VK_ALPHA_G1: [u8; 64] = [0u8; 64];  // Should be actual bytes
static IC_ARRAY: [[u8; 64]; 9] = [[0u8; 64]; 9];  // Should be 9 real IC points
```

### The Solution Needed
1. Read `circuits/build/vk_bytes.json` (3584 bytes total)
2. Parse structure:
   - Bytes 0-63: vk_alpha_g1
   - Bytes 64-191: vk_beta_g2
   - Bytes 192-319: vk_gamme_g2 (note typo!)
   - Bytes 320-447: vk_delta_g2
   - Bytes 448-1023: IC[0] through IC[8] (9 points × 64 bytes)

### Test Status
```bash
cargo test --lib real_proof_test -- --nocapture
# FAILS with: "Failed to negate proof A: InvalidProofFormat"
# Also fails verification due to placeholder VK
```

## 🐛 Errors Encountered & Solutions

### Session 1 (Completed)
1. ✅ **Windows Linker Conflict** - Git's link.exe shadowing MSVC → Switched to Ubuntu
2. ✅ **Borrow Checker Errors** - Fixed by extracting values before mutable borrow
3. ✅ **Compilation Timeout** - 10+ min on WSL → 2 min on Ubuntu native
4. ✅ **Import Errors** - Fixed missing imports in test files

### Session 2 (Current)
1. ❌ **Verifying Key Structure** - Groth16Verifyingkey fields different than expected
2. ❌ **IC Points Array** - Need static array with 9 points, currently using empty placeholder
3. ❌ **Proof A Negation** - Failing with InvalidProofFormat, needs investigation
4. ✅ **Path Issues** - Fixed include_bytes! path from `../../../../` to `../../../`

## ✅ What's Actually Working

### Cryptographic Verification ✅
All Poseidon hashes match JavaScript implementation perfectly:
```
Test 1: 0x115cc0f5e7d690413df64c6b9662e9cf2a3617f2743245519e19607a4417189a ✅
Test 2: 0x239edbf1e6b4f5646471d24e63b1ab7992897e0ecefa6b565302f64fe1e49117 ✅
Test 3: 0x0e7a333190bcbb4f654dbefca544b4a2b0644d05dce3fdc11e6df0b6e4fa57d4 ✅
```

### Circuit & Proof Generation ✅
- Circuit: `withdraw_fixed.circom` with 8 public inputs
- Constraints: 5,897 (optimized)
- Proof generation: 800ms
- Proof size: 256 bytes
- Public inputs: root, nullifierHash, recipientH/L, relayerH/L, fee, refund

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps for Next Agent

### Priority 1: Fix Verifying Key (CRITICAL)
1. Open `programs/tornado_solana/src/verifying_key.rs`
2. Implement proper byte loading from `vk_bytes.json`
3. Create static arrays with actual values
4. Test with: `cargo test --lib verifying_key::tests -- --nocapture`

### Priority 2: Fix Proof A Negation
1. Debug why `negate_proof_a` fails with real proof
2. Check endianness conversion
3. Verify proof format matches snarkjs output

### Priority 3: Verify Real Proof
1. Once VK is fixed, run: `cargo test --lib real_proof_test -- --nocapture`
2. Should see: "✅ Real proof verified successfully!"
3. Measure compute units (must be < 200k)

# Run all tests
cargo test --lib -- --nocapture

# Run real proof test (currently failing)

## 📌 Critical Code Sections

### Proof Structure (lib.rs:359-382)
- Handles proof A negation (currently failing)
- Double endianness conversion (BE→LE→BE)
- Uses `deserialize_uncompressed` for 64-byte points

### Public Inputs (lib.rs:386-428)
- Exactly 8 inputs required
- Addresses split into high/low (16 bytes each)
- Fee/refund as right-aligned big-endian

### Verifying Key (verifying_key.rs)
- **NEEDS FIX**: Currently returns placeholders
- Should load 3584 bytes from `vk_bytes.json`
- Must include 9 IC points for 8 public inputs

## 📝 Consultant Feedback Addressed

1. ✅ **Real Circuit** - Using withdraw_fixed.circom
2. ✅ **Trusted Setup** - Generated withdraw_final.zkey
3. ✅ **Real Proof** - Created from actual circuit
4. ❌ **Verification** - Fails due to VK integration
5. ⏳ **Compute Units** - Can't measure until verification works

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FOR NEXT AGENT

**THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT TASK**: Fix `verifying_key.rs` to load real bytes

The consultant said: *"Until you successfully verify a real proof from your circuit on-chain, the system is not ready for deployment."*

We have:
- ✅ Real circuit
- ✅ Real proof  
- ✅ Real verifying key (in vk_bytes.json)
- ❌ Integration between them

Once the verifying key is properly loaded, the system should be ready for deployment.
